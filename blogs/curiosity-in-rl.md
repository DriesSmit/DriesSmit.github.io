Deep reinforcement learning is a power general purpose framework that can be used to train agents to solve various tasks. However defining rewards for each task might not always be feasible. Imagine you have a large open-ended environment. Would it not be great if we could somehow allow our agents to first explore the environment on its own? Then we can easily fine-tune them to solve any downstream task we care about. In <a href="https://medium.com/@dries.epos/curious-agents-ebfee02ef024"  target="_blank">this</a> blog we investigate methods that can allow our agents to do just that. Enjoy!
