My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within machine learning. My previous work has been focused on reinforcement learning, delving into its applications in multi-agent systems, meta-learning, and the exploration of reward-free, curiosity-driven frameworks. 

Recently, my attention has shifted towards the field of conversational large language models (LLMs), particularly within the medical domain.
