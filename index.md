My research interests cover a broad spectrum of machine learning topics. Initially, my work centered on reinforcement learning, exploring its applications in multi-agent systems, meta-learning, and reward-free, curiosity-driven frameworks.

More recently, my focus has shifted to the domain of conversational large language models (LLMs), with a specific interest in their application within the medical field.
