Deep reinforcement learning is a power general purpose framework that can be used to train agents to solve various tasks. However defining rewards for each task might not always be feasible. Imagine you have a large open-ended environment. Would it not be great if we could somehow allow our agents to first explore the environment on its own? Then we can easily fine-tune them to solve any downstream task we care about. In this series we investigate methods that can allow our agents to do just that.
